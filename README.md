BloodValU - Final Project Propulsion Academy

Personal Notes

I worked on this project with three other bootcamp students. The project lasted for 3 week. 
My jobs was mainly working on the frontend with React/Redux. The project was originally developed on Gitlab.

Project description

We are trying to tackle two common phenomena:

Repeated blood shortages due to a lack of donors.
Regular visits to the doctor by many, often young and healthy people merely to
“check” blood values.

Our approach will address this by:

We will create non-monetary incentives for donors, particularly those from the target
group mentioned above, to donate blood regularly. In simple terms, the model is
based on a points system: for each donation, the donor is credited with a certain
number of points, which can then be exchanged for a blood test. The results can
then be called upon directly via a web application.
